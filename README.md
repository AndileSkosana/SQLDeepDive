# SQLDeepDive
A deep dive into SQL for data engineers using PostgreSQL.

1. Use the CREATEDB file to create a local copy of the db on your local server engine. 

2. Copy the script and PASTE it in a query in pgAdmin and run it as a query to create the db and the db objects.

3. Run some of the queries in the Test_SQL file to ensure that your DB is correct.

4. Create the db objects on your local copy of the database. 

5. Create the working db objects on the production database. Use the naming convention as follows 
   DE{first three characters of your first name}{first three characters of your first surname}
   eg. Dora Explorer = DEDOREXP;
       View = DEDOREXP_{View_Name}
       SPROC = DEDOREXP_{sproc_Name}

6. Save the scripts as files and place them in a zipped folder. Email the zipped folder to your head teacher.
