1. For each order, calculate a subtotal for each Order (identified by OrderID). This is a simple query using GROUP BY to aggregate data for each order.
Select OrderID, 
    format(sum(UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)), 2) as Subtotal
from order_details
group by OrderID
order by OrderID;

2. This query shows how to get the year part from Shipped_Date column. A subtotal is calculated by a sub-query for each order. The sub-query forms a table and then joined with the Orders table.
Select distinct date(a.ShippedDate) as ShippedDate, 
    a.OrderID, 
    b.Subtotal, 
    year(a.ShippedDate) as Year
from Orders a 
inner join
(
    -- Get subtotal for each order
    select distinct OrderID, 
        format(sum(UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)), 2) as Subtotal
    from order_details
    group by OrderID    
) b on a.OrderID = b.OrderID
where a.ShippedDate is not null
    and a.ShippedDate between date('1996-12-24') and date('1997-09-30')
order by a.ShippedDate;

3. For each employee, get their sales amount, broken down by country name.
Select distinct b.*, a.CategoryName
from Categories a 
inner join Products b on a.CategoryID = b.CategoryID
where b.Discontinued = 'N'
order by b.ProductName;

4. This is a rather simple query to get an alphabetical list of products.
select distinct b.*, a.Category_Name
from Categories a 
inner join Products b on a.Category_ID = b.Category_ID
where b.Discontinued = 'N'
order by b.Product_Name;
